"For tutorials, it is very good to let the students search for themselves. However, you shouldn't let them search for too long either. Indeed, your questionnaire mainly concerns the pace of online courses but personally and my friends had a lot of difficulty with the tutorials. Most of the time we came away from the session with just the answer even though we didn't have the mathematical approach. I understand the course with the tutorials, if I don't have the whole process, I won't understand. Also for online courses, what's the point of using a digital format if you have to write down the formulas on the keyboard, it's infeasible, you might as well go to paper format, which is not suitable for everyone",negative

I would have preferred that the Q and A sessions be replaced by tutorials. Regarding tutorials I prefer when you perform a typical exercise step by step with the teacher and gain autonomy gradually. On certain tutorial I felt lost.,negative
To have wanted to make the presence in tutorial mandatory since not all courses were being taken in a timely manner to make tutorial more passive than active,neutral

"I really liked the online course moodle because it allowed me to really be involved with 100% in learning, without being disturbed by the noise in amphi etc. However, for students in difficulty I like to have some sessions",neutral
"Viewing the course online allows for much more active note-taking than in lectures in a lecture hall. This allows a better understanding of the notes from the first time they are seen. I think it is easier to get your attention in an amphitheater course, since we are participants in the course, and we can go at the pace that suits us.",positive

"Make the session more interactive in amphitheatre, setting up wooclaps as in the first session that I think was the most productive because it allowed us to measure our understanding of the course in relation to the various questions",positive

"We would have to make an annals in class at the end of the semester and the students take advantage of it to ask questions. I didn't really like this way of learning, it should be a complement to the master course",negative
"Although we are in a group and we have reviewed the course before coming to tutorials, the latter are, most of the time, hard and the clues given during the session are sometimes too light. On the other hand, after redoing the tutorials with the correction, we understand the reasoning quite quickly although certain calculation steps are sometimes difficult to understand.",negative
"Despite many hours of face-to-face tutorial work and independent or group work to prepare for the final, the exam went poorly, particularly due to my lack of self-confidence in this subject (mathematically retaining/mastering the formulas at the time). perfection), I think that a realistic approach (course reminder or authorized form), would make it possible to better understand exercises, and not to waste precious time finding formulas, the complexity of the exercises making the work all the more hard",negative
The online courses are too long and it would be necessary to vary with master classes to better understand or give more explanations in the videos (and detailed calculations!),negative
no comment,neutral
Too much distanciel in my opinion for the understanding of the course,negative
"Quite an interesting approach for independent students. Personally, I very rarely go to lectures in other subjects and this allowed me to follow the courses independently, when I wanted and at the desired speed. On the other hand, I think it can be very complicated to be rigorous and you can easily get lost and be very late but there is no possible solution for this problem.",negative
"Maybe divide the videos of the course so that they are less long, less than 5 minutes, see that a video is too long demoralize.",negative
No,neutral
"I have no comment, I enjoyed this pedagogy very much, which allowed us to work independently when we were focused and really motivated.",positive
It's a very efficient method that has made the matter very interesting and affordable for me. I need to work in autonomy and at my own pace so it matched me perfectly,positive
"I think that the online courses are very interesting, but we are too isolated plus the speed of explaining the applications is sometimes much too fast so we have no time at all to understand and therefore we completely lose track",negative
the videos are very clear and well explained,positive
"This working method is very autonomous, this can be good for the courses because it is true that it is difficult to concentrate during a lecture with a large class like ours, this therefore allows you to do the course independently when you wish but it depends but concerning the tutorials, this method was not suitable for me because we were too independent and did not progress at the pace, it was therefore sometimes difficult to understand the corrections because we were not not everyone has the same question. I prefer that we all move forward with the exercises together. Concerning the exercises on moodle, the correction was sometimes not very detailed so I did not do them.",negative
I regret that the training done at the tutorial level seen with the teacher as well as the exercises of the digital courses were not enough to succeed well the part that was proposed to us,negative

"In terms of tutorials, I find it a shame that we spend most of the sessions just demonstrating formulas that have been explained and demonstrated in the online course. In addition, we sometimes reworked exercises from the online course, but if you follow the online course, you have already done them so it is a waste of time. I would have liked to have more different dexo (on the same notions but with different statements and subtleties which sometimes change found S, sometimes X, sometimes Q, sometimes V...). Workshop work is a good thing, but the problem is that there is often a gap in the groups because some people take the course online and others rely on the tutorials to understand the course. For people taking the online course, the workshop work is sometimes more of a waste of time than work.",negative

leave the workshops in supervised work but make a collective correction on the board,positive
"I was a little disturbed by this learning system even if it is an interesting system. However, I think that there is a lack of summary sessions for each course, like a lecture course but which covers the important elements and/or questions and answers regularly, not at the end of the semester (a bit like the review session in the form of a card mental but at the end of each chapter). In addition, I think that the quiz could be on paper, this could allow you to have a few points ahead before the final (from my experience I understood better and succeeded in doing the demonstrations/calculations of the quiz than the final but I didn't get the average and I think that doing it on paper would have allowed me to get the average).",negative
