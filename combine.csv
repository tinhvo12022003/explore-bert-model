"The little Moodle quizzes were good for understanding, but perhaps not enough to practice and see different situations (1 or 2 more maximum)",neutral
"I appreciated being able to sit down calmly to do the course, especially with the paper format. Videos help to energize, however they are too fast and don't leave time to think. In addition, the time spent on these sessions was greater than a normal course duration if we want to do it well.",positive
"method appreciated for the autonomy of work and organization it grants. The regular tutorial sessions allowed me to stay up to date on the essential elements despite my big gap in following the course. It is more pleasant to follow a course when you are in good conditions than during an imposed schedule with an imposed pace without taking into account the fatigue or difficulties of each person. Despite a big delay in following the courses, this teaching method allowed me to catch up at my own pace and to be able to prepare properly for the exams. It's a surprising method at first but seeing the result and the satisfaction of understanding what we're doing at our own pace that it brings, it's a method that I really appreciated.",positive

"For exercise work, it is very good to let the students search for themselves. However, you shouldn't let them search for too long either. Indeed, your questionnaire mainly concerns the pace of online courses but personally and my friends had a lot of difficulty with the exercise work. Most of the time we came away from the session with just the answer even though we didn't have the mathematical approach. I understand the course with the exercise work, if I don't have the whole process, I won't understand. Also for online courses, what's the point of using a digital format if you have to write down the formulas on the keyboard, it's infeasible, you might as well go to paper format, which is not suitable for everyone.",negative

"I really liked the moodle online course because it allowed me to really be 100% involved in the learning, without being disturbed by the noise in the lecture hall etc. However, for students in difficulty I like to have a few lecture sessions where the course is explained out loud by the teacher because sometimes I realize that I understand poorly/not enough alone. Also, working on the exercise work independently like this helped me a lot to learn the application, but sometimes with the answer key only on moodle I had difficulty understanding some points",positive
"""Viewing the course online allows for much more active note-taking than in a lecture course in a lecture hall. This allows for a better understanding of the notes from the first time they are seen.

"Class reports should be made at the end of the semester and students take the opportunity to ask questions. I didn't really like this method of learning, it should be a complement to the lecture course with some lectures however in a lecture hall for the important points especially at the beginning. However, the greater number of exercise work is a very good point. Thank you for this year, have a great holiday",negative
"Although we are in a group and we have reviewed the course before coming to class, the latter are, most of the time, hard and the clues given during the session are sometimes too light. On the other hand, after redoing the exercise work with the correction, we understand the reasoning quite quickly although certain calculation steps are sometimes difficult to understand",negative
"""Despite many hours of face-to-face tutorials and work independently or in groups to prepare for the final, the exam went poorly, particularly due to my lack of self-confidence in this subject (mathematically + retaining/mastering the formulas a perfection), I think that a more ""realistic"" approach (course reminder or authorized form), would allow us to better understand exercises, and not waste precious time finding formulas, the complexity of the exercises making the work is even harder.""",negative
The online courses are too long and it would be necessary to vary with lectures to better understand or give more explanations in the videos (and detailed calculations!),negative
no comment,neutral
Too much distance in my opinion for understanding the course,negative
"Quite an interesting approach for independent students. Personally, I very rarely go to lectures in other subjects and this allowed me to follow the courses independently, when I wanted and at the desired speed. On the other hand, I think it can be very complicated to be rigorous and you can easily get lost and be very late but there is no possible solution for this problem.",negative
"Maybe divide the course videos so that they are shorter, less than 5 minutes, seeing that a video is too long is demoralizing.",negative
no,neutral
"I have no comments, I really appreciated this teaching method which allowed you to work independently when you were concentrated and really motivated.",neutral
It is a very effective method and has made the subject very interesting and accessible to me. I need to work independently and at my own pace so this suited me perfectly,positive
"I think that the online courses are very interesting, but we are too isolated... plus the speed of explaining the applications is sometimes much too fast so we have no time at all to understand and therefore we completely drop out...",negative
the videos are very clear and well explained,positive
"This working method is very autonomous, this can be good for the courses because it is true that it is difficult to concentrate during a lecture with a large class like ours, this therefore allows you to do the course independently when you wish but it depends but concerning the exercise work, this method was not suitable for me because we were too independent and did not move at the pace, it was therefore sometimes difficult to understand the corrections because we were not everyone has the same question.. I prefer that we all move forward with the exercises together. Concerning the exercises on moodle, the correction was sometimes not very detailed so I did not do them.",negative

"In terms of exercise work, I find it a shame that we spend most of the sessions ""just"" demonstrating formulas that have been explained and demonstrated in the online course. In addition, we have sometimes reworked exercises from the online course, but if you follow the online course, you have already done them so it is a waste of time. I would have liked to have more different dexo (on the same notions but with different statements and subtleties that change: sometimes found S, sometimes X, sometimes Q, sometimes V...). Workshop work is a good thing, but the problem is that there is often a gap in the groups because some people follow the course online and others rely on the exercise work to understand the course. For people taking the online course, the workshop work is sometimes more of a waste of time than work.",negative

However, I think that there is a lack of ""summary sessions"" of each course, like a lectures but which covers the important elements and/or questions answered regularly, not at the end of the semester (a bit like the review session in the form of mental map but at the end of each chapter). In addition, I think that the quiz could be on paper, this could allow you to have a few points ahead before the final (from my experience: I understood better and managed to do the demonstrations/calculations of the quiz than the final but I didn't get the average and I think that doing it on paper would have allowed me to get the average).",negative
